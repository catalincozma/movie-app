# Movie App

Simple Android app in Kotlin displaying movies via an API.

## Setup

- Clone the repo
- API key is defined as a constant in the code (not in `local.properties`)
- Open in Android Studio and run

## Notes

- API key is hardcoded for testing â€” avoid exposing real keys publicly
- `local.properties` is ignored by Git

## License

For testing and interview purposes only.
